Welcome to Fortune 13, an immersive roleplay experience for those seeking to appreciate the dangers of a post-apocalyptic wasteland! These rules will serve to cover the innumerable amount of possible roleplay situations as possible - though the ruling decision is ultimately up to the administrator. If you have any questions, utilize an adminhelp (F1) and ask us for help or oversight!<br>
Rules:<br>

  
General
0. Don't e a dick, nor employ loopholes. If you are found weaponizing rules for situations which are inherently damaging to roleplay or to get an ultra greentext, you will be handled accordingly. We're all playing here to enjoy ourselves, not fight and argue with assholes. Use common sense, don't tarnish the experience for others.<br>

1. You must be 18+ years of age to join the community and play in our servers as there are adult themed references and interactions.<br>

2. No racism and no toxicity, slurs of any kind will not be tolerated. This extends to unnecessary aggression or hostility in OOC outlets over IC occurrences. IC and OOC remain to be two different fields of interaction here on Fortune 13.<br>

2.1. Don't harshly criticize other servers without ample reasoning.<br>

3. Always stay in character. You may only break away in LOOC or OOC to resolve issues if there's no other viable way of doing so.<br>

4. Do not metagame. Metagaming falls under usage of knowledge you haven't learned in-character, this may fall under broad knowledge of the Enclave and knowledge of their base, having thorough knowledge of a dungeon, extensive knowledge of technology unfamiliar to the common wastelander.<br> 

5. English is the main required language to use while playing. You must speak English or be able to write it in order for our staff to assist you as well as the community. It is recommended you have an Upper-Intermediate capability of understanding and writing in the English language. If you do not, you may be directed to other servers.<br>

6. Do not kill AFK or disconnected players. Move them somewhere safe but do not steal from them or harm them.<br> 

7. Do not share any personal information of any of the community members to anyone else. No private information should be disclosed within server resources. If there is a personal feud between individuals that involves personal information outside of the community your access to our resources will be denied to protect our community members.<br>

8. Do not judge people's roleplay, don’t poke fun, don’t go out of your way to harass people or create grudges. Have fun and enjoy yourself. People will make mistakes, as you make mistakes, learn from them and be patient as others do the same so that way we can create something great.<br>

8.2 If a players roleplay serves to be detrimental to the roleplay atmosphere, you may make a ticket through adminhelp (F1), and an admin will investigate and handle it at their own discretion and judgement.<br> 

Escalation<br>

9. Try to roleplay when fighting, always have a conversation and try to work things out before resorting to mechanics. In order to fight there must be escalation. It begins with a conversation, emotes with intentions and combat ready from both sides before fighting mechanically may begin. Be polite and respectable so both players are ready to fight before starting.<br>

9.2 At the dawning minutes of a round, you may not mug or wait outside of player spawn points to then kill or rob a player. The timer for muggings to be able to commence is ten minutes into a round. You may make an ahelp asking for permission to do so before this time. It is not courteous to your fellow player to relieve them of their belongings when they haven't even begun their round.<br> 

10. You may only raid bases or player homes after receiving approval from staff. Ahelp and state what you'd like to raid and why. Be robust with your talking, emotes and combat indicators!<br>

10.2 Should a faction retreat into their base after an engagement at their own doormat, you may make a ticket for permission to raid.<br> 

11. Factions may only choose one enemy to pursue per round. This serves to dissolve the purely TDM mindset, whilst we allow for lenient combat - this server is not the place to get your fix for mindless mayhem, unless an RP situation calls for it. The build-up should involve sufficient roleplay for both sides to enjoy, then begin hostilities whilst keeping common courtesy in mind.<br> 

11.2 Non-faction groups and or players must abide by this similarly.<br>

12. If you enter a faction base without approval from the faction you may be shot on sight. During escalation if the attacker gives you rules such as "If you pull a gun you will be shot" then they may shoot you if you pull a gun. If you call for backup on your radio or pip boy then you are accepting escalation and may be shot. If you attempt to run away immediately when a player is escalating on you they may fight you but it MUST be clear that the attacker IS HOSTILE and has clearly made their intentions of violence known. Do not just point to a person and if they run immediately shoot them. Give chase and if you pulled a gun already telling them to comply with an order and THEN they run by all means open fire. Also if you steal something wordlessly and run away immediately without any emotes or interaction with the person you steal from you are valid and may be shot on sight.<br>

Examples: A player runs up and steals a stack of caps from a vending machine then takes off. They are valid and may be killed without any interaction.<br>

A player tells another to STOP moving or be shot and the player runs, they may be killed.<br>

A player runs into a faction base deep picking things up and not communicating with anyone or when spotted tries to flee. They can be shot on sight.<br>

A player is stopped and told to get on the ground as they are going to be kidnapped. That player calls for help on their radio, they are accepting escalation and may be shot.<br>

13.  No faction allies. The Major factions cannot ally to take each other down during raids or major skirmishes without a VERY good in character reason. Situational alliances may not last beyond the round either. Minor factions may create alliances however they only last for the round they were formed in. Ex: A small raider gang being hired by the NCR, Legion or BOS to aide them. Ex: Oasis must have a good reason to align with the NCR as much as they would the Legion. Taxes, or slavery? ICly, the consequences will transcend the given round to your character. OOCly, continuity does not apply to this, other than brief friendship knowledge.<br>

14. Do not abuse any game breaking mechanics. Do not abuse mechanics intentionally for a PVP or PVE advantage. You may use things like barricades, buildings and such for PVE but do not throw a lock on a door during PVP to try to gain an unfair advantage. Exploitation of bugs fall under this similarly, if you abuse mechanics to gain an advantage over others, you will be given an extended ban. Report bugs, don't use them.<br>

14.2. If you die during a fight you are not allowed to respawn and re-engage in that fight. For instance if the Enclave and BOS are having a battle and you die during it you may not respawn as either side of that faction to assist with the fighting. Long after the incident is completed however you may respawn as that faction WITHOUT the knowledge of it occurring unless informed icly. Regardless you are expected not to respawn as another character so you can join in the fighting in any scenario.<br>

15. You may destroy bodies but do not destroy the brain of the person that you're killing. Keep it in tact so they have a minute chance of being revived.<br>

16. If you die and stay dead for an excess of 10 minutes then you will not remember the events that lead up to your death prior when revived.<br>

17. Do not partake in faction/group conflicts not of your own without escalating and letting yourself be known as a combatant. If you intend on aiding one side, you may identify yourself with the faction appropriate apparel, or otherwise verbally state your intentions to aid one side - enabling combat mode, and giving a few moments of understanding before opening fire.<br>

18. When in combat if you leave the area or flee for the duration of 2 Minutes or more you must re-escalate once you run back into the individuals you may have been fighting. You may not have a little gunfight, run across the map and 5 minutes later spring out of the bushes to shoot someone to death with no re escalation.<br>

Character and Roleplay Expectations<br>

19. Erotic roleplay is allowed but you must follow a few guidelines. First off no underage references at ALL. Second you must get OOC consent from the player to do so. If you’re doing a non consensual scene you both must verify that you’re accepting it. Third try to be subtle about it and keep to yourself. This way you wont get judged, you won't be harassed and you can enjoy your roleplay in privacy.<br>

20. Do not hold grudges and pursue people for things that happened in previous rounds. IE: Do not hunt down someone who killed you last round to kill them the following round. Be creative but do not hold grudges.<br>

21. Keep characters individual, do not respawn as the same character if they’ve died in that round.<br>

To elaborate about role and character expectations. You are expected to create a character with some sort of background that does not switch between the roles consistently without a very good reason ICly. For instance you should not be switching from recruit to leadership or medic to soldier. Play a role with a good character background or you'll be punished.<br>

21.2. Players are to create well-rounded, plausible characters for the setting. A Legionary will not use modern slang, say things such as 'Bruh' or alike due to their tribal backgrounds. An NCR trooper will not act alike to a raider, and a Brotherhood of Steel member will value those of their chapter like family, things such as murder for trivial things being a rogue concept to them. Certain roles are exempt from this aspect due to the inherent silliness shown in Fallout, Outlaws, lower-rankings of the NCR may be a little less disciplined, and other such roles. If you are confused or have questions on whether this may apply to your character, you may make a ticket, and an administrator will deem whether you are abiding by roleplay expectation.<br>

22. Try your best to play to your role. Basic expectations for every role are pretty simple...As a Legionnaire expect to follow orders and the lore of the Legion, NCR, BOS, Followers, Enclave, etc are all the same. Also try your best to follow your IC leadership with some good roleplay. If you straight up just decline to follow the chain of command you will suffer IC consequences up to getting demoted, exiled, or job banned from your position for failing to comply.<br>

23. Do not have a silly meme style name. Make sure your name is roleplay appropriate. A legionary named 'Biggus Dickus' or a name alike to a meme or indicator to something else is not permitted.<br>
